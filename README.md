\## What is MiniMail?



MiniMail is a revolutionary email platform that reimagines digital communication through two beautiful concepts:



\### 1. Pronoun-Based Communication

Connect with others using their preferred pronouns as natural email addresses:

\- they@zhe

\- she@he 

\- he@me

\- ze@they

\- And many more inclusive options - use the small community to email someone who resonates



\### 2. Midsummer Flower Messages

Send messages inspired by the ancient tradition of picking flowers on Midsummer Day:

\- yellow@daisy - Send to someone who picked a yellow daisy

\- purple@lavender - Connect with purple lavender gatherers

\- white@rose - Reach out to white rose collectors



\## Features
